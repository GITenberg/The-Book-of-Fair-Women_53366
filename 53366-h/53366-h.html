          <span style=
          "font-size: 144%; font-variant: italics">BEAUTY</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Beauty is only skin deep,”</span> cries Ugliness,
          pinning her faith on the fascination of the Intelligence.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“And ugliness goes to the bone,”</span>
          Beauty replies, though she fears that that shaft of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“wit”</span> must have originally been spoken by a
          pantomime librettist. <span class="tei tei-q">“Handsome is as
          handsome does,”</span> retorts Ugliness, quoting from the Plain
          Woman's volume of Copy-Book Maxims. And so this battle of words
          goes on.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Beauty cares
          nothing at all for maxims. She puts on her most becoming hat, her
          daintiest dress, and goes forth careless and indifferent to
          anything except Middle Age. No shaft of Puritanical censure, she
          feels, can hurt her. Beauty is its own <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "fr">raison d'etre—</span></em>its own excuse for being gloriously
          alive. It needs no apology, no panic balancing of its debit account
          by moral and intellectual compensations hurriedly placed to its
          credit. In Heaven, it knows, more people will want to call upon
          Ninon de l'Enclos than wish to leave cards on St. Theresa of Spain.
          And what is more satisfying to Beauty than a large audience? Only
          two things really terrify her—the loss of her Good Looks and the
          loss of her Youth. That may be the reason why, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "fr">au fond</span></em>, she sometimes envies her plainer sisters
          almost as much as they envy her. Perhaps she knows that they play a
          waiting game, and that at fifty-five it might have been as well for
          her had she been born <span class="tei tei-q">“plain”</span> too,
          since henceforward she must enter the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“plain”</span> woman's world as a stranger, to live as
          they live, but, unlike them, to be for ever tortured by the remark:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“All the same, she was a great beauty
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          the way her friends apologize for her false teeth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
          meanwhile, however, she triumphs—triumphs overwhelmingly. To the
          purely physical lure Reason is as unreasoning as Lunacy. In spite
          of that French saying which states that <span class="tei tei-q">“il
          faut souffrir pour etre belle,”</span> how often great suffering
          and great happiness go through life hand in hand, the one utterly
          dependent upon the other. Only the commonplace <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“soul”</span> revels in the smug security of the
          commonplace. Life at its fullest is surely a great joy, as well as
          a great pain!</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page12">[pg
          12]</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And Beauty—how
          glibly we utter the word! Indeed, how glibly we utter all those
          words, the meaning of which is so difficult clearly to define!
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Democracy,”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Liberty,”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Freedom,”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Friendship,”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Love”</span>—and, let it be owned, the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Hereafter”</span>!—how often we use the words as a
          kind of final argument, and how often, so mesmerized has become our
          Intelligence by these words, do we accept them without question as
          something appertaining to finality. It is the same with Beauty. To
          call a woman <span class="tei tei-q">“beautiful”</span> requires no
          corollary. That is all that need be said! Merely to say it,
          especially if the word is spoken by some one in High Authority, is
          sometimes sufficient to create a reputation for loveliness—as women
          who have been the mistresses of kings know full well. The world
          asks so little more of a beautiful woman than her beauty. Which
          perhaps accounts—though in a book of Beautiful Women let it be
          printed in small type—for so many lovely women being intellectually
          dull! But then, if one is good to look upon, one can afford to be
          dreary company. Loveliness is its own forgiveness of intellectual
          sins. It is a <span class="tei tei-q">“decoration,”</span> and we
          do not ask of decorations to be more than perfect in regard to
          colouring and symmetry of line. Success is, after all, but a
          reflection of ourselves in the world, and Beauty finds its
          reflection in almost every human eye and in almost every human
          heart. Its way through life is indeed strewn with roses—those
          lovely flowers which hide such very vindictive thorns.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">God makes
          beautiful women; a Plain Woman has to do the best she can for
          herself. Her only hope lies in the fact that what fascinates Tom
          may leave Dick indifferent—and who knows but that Harry will find
          that she herself is more attractive than any other woman? Which
          brings me back to a definition of Beauty, and that, being at heart
          a sluggard, I had purposely wished to avoid.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Beauty”</span> is to me but another name for
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Harmony.”</span> It is harmonious to some
          ideal indigenous to the <span class="tei tei-q">“soul.”</span> It
          may only be <span class="tei tei-q">“skin deep,”</span> as the
          Plain Woman likes to assert for the benefit of vain schoolgirls,
          but the beholding eye nevertheless endows it with <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“spirituality.”</span> It likes to believe this
          loveliness is only an outer symbol of an inner spiritual grace.
          Which fact will account in some way for different types of
          beautiful women appealing to different types of men—so that even an
          ugly woman sometimes hears herself addressed in the language Mars
          probably used to Venus.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page13">[pg
          13]</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We find in
          Beauty something more than a realization of what we believe to be
          perfection; we find in it a <span class="tei tei-q">“journey's
          end”</span>—or perhaps I ought to say <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“lodgment,”</span> seeing that Beauty is so often
          fleeting—in the lonely search of the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“soul”</span> after spiritual sustenance. We give to it
          our adoration, an adoration which none the less overwhelms us
          emotionally because, physically speaking, it is passionless. We bow
          in worship before it, without—if I may express myself in metaphor
          tinged with vulgarity—an insensate desire to Clutch. For Beauty is
          also a <span class="tei tei-q">“message”</span>; and, as it appeals
          to something within our <span class="tei tei-q">“souls,”</span> so
          does that <span class="tei tei-q">“message”</span> become the more
          eloquent. Moreover, it has a thousand facets. We can find it
          anywhere, in almost everything that is not mean or debased,
          hypocritical or dishonest. Nevertheless, there are some men who can
          find beauty only in sex; men who are deaf to that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“song within a song”</span> which in the hearts of so
          many is as the Psalm of Life. The view of distant mountains; the
          glowing, dancing reflection of the sun setting out at sea; the
          quiet, verdant valleys, whose peacefulness falls on the troubled
          spirit as a benediction; a voice, a memory, a prayer—all these
          things can uplift the heart until momentarily it may live in a
          whole world of beauty. For Beauty must be <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">felt</span></em>
          within the <span class="tei tei-q">“soul.”</span> The senses but
          convey an impression, the <span class="tei tei-q">“soul”</span>
          translates that impression into terms of Ecstacy. For when we come
          face to face with Beauty, in whatever guise, all that is best and
          purest in our Nature stirs in response, so that at last our
          <span class="tei tei-q">“soul”</span> cannot live without Beauty.
          Robbed, as it were, for ever of this harmony, which seems to
          reflect Heaven, even in lowly places, it withers and dies. The man
          who seeks not Beauty can scarcely be said to live; since without
          beauty Life is but a barren wilderness, sodden by the tears of men.
          The Road to God is paved by Music and Poetry, by Art and
          Literature, by all those manifestations of Beauty which are
          unselfishness, renunciation, friendship, love, sympathy,
          understanding, humility. Man is Spirit as well as Body, and just as
          the physical needs must be satisfied, so must the Spirit find
          Beauty if it wither not nor die. Through Beauty God speaks to men;
          and inasmuch as we seek to bring Beauty into our lives and into the
          lives of others, so we come into closer communion with Him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Beauty, then, is
          something which is in complete harmony with the longings of the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“soul,”</span> and through the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“soul”</span> with God. The old belief <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page14">[pg 14]</span> that Beauty is the seed the
          Devil sows to reap his human harvest is an exploded blasphemy.
          Surround men with Ugliness and they will quickly qualify themseves
          for a place in Hell. We take from our surroundings as much, perhaps
          even more, than we give to them. Thus Beauty is surely the great
          ally of Virtue: to the extent that it sometimes fails in its
          alliance, so does it lack true perfection. For as much as our
          so-called civilization is worth to us in happiness, the gift has
          been a gift from the great poets, the great writers, the great
          thinkers, the great musicians and painters—all those who have
          sought to bring the message of beauty to this world, including that
          supreme artist Nature herself. And this is true, no matter how much
          the politicians, the commercial magnates, kings, princes, and
          potentates may preen themselves on their human importance, pointing
          to their laws, their factories, their palaces, all the evidences of
          their temporal power. Their <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“message”</span> to humanity has only been the fact of
          their own success, whereas, the potent <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“message”</span> of Beauty is at all times a silent
          one, though more eloquent, more uplifting, more encouraging than
          all the pompous diatribes that were ever uttered. In the greatest,
          most inspiring moments of our lives we are always dumb. No words
          can then express the triumphant melody which is surging in our
          hearts. To the extent that we can explain our emotion, so we feel
          it less. Thus in the presence of something beautiful we are at all
          times mute. The strength of its appeal is shown in our subsequent
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ACTS</span></em>; and actions, we know, speak
          far, far louder than words.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Beauty, then, is
          something which, uplifting us, strengthens the soul, helps the
          spirit to rise above the deadening influence of the commonplace
          monotony of the Everyday. It may not necessarily be essential to
          our success in this world, though to surround oneself with Beauty
          is surely one of the ideals which spur us onward to the attainment
          of riches, but it is surely essential to our salvation! It is, as
          it were, the golden thread which runs through the plain homespun of
          life. Without it the pattern of our days would be distinctly
          <span class="tei tei-q">“drab”</span> on a buff ground. Everything
          that is physically fine; everything that is noble and just,
          generous and kind; everything which gladdens our hearts and sends
          us on our way rejoicing; everything which, as it were, lifts our
          faces up towards God in the high heavens—that surely is <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Beautiful!</span></em> I always like to think
          that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page15">[pg 15]</span> Shelley in
          his essay on <span class="tei tei-q">“Love”</span> made Love
          synonymous with Beauty: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou demandest
          what is Love?”</span> he wrote. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is that
          powerful attraction towards all that we conceive of fear, or hope
          beyond ourselves, when we find within our own thoughts the chasm of
          an insufficient void, and seek to awaken in all things that are, a
          community with what we experience within ourselves. If we reason,
          we would be understood; if we imagine, we would that the airy
          children of our brain were born anew within another's; if we feel,
          we would that another's nerves should kindle at once and mix and
          melt into our own, that lips of motionless ice should not reply to
          lips quivering and burning with the heart's best blood. This is
          Love. This is the bond and sanction which connects not only man
          with man, but with everything which exists.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To make the
          world more and more beautiful, not in a narrow sense, but in the
          widest and deepest sense possible, that surely ought to be the
          ideal of civilization. And in this ideal, physical beauty has
          surely an important place allotted to it. One is virtuous, after
          all, for one's own benefit; one <span class="tei tei-q">“makes the
          best of oneself”</span> for the benefit of the whole world. There
          is no virtue in being plain, though I must confess it usually makes
          virtue a much easier achievement. As a rule, Nature is more often a
          conscientious than an inspired artist, and there is nothing mere
          conscientiousness requires more than a helping hand. That
          conscientiousness has also its divinely inspired moments—moments
          which come to it unpremeditated and unforeseen—that also is a fad.
          That is why Nature, who <span class="tei tei-q">“bungle”</span> her
          best points hopelessly so often, does occasionally achieve a
          veritable <span class="tei tei-q">“masterpiece.”</span> That, too,
          is why Beautiful Women have every reason to be proud of their
          loveliness and seek to preserve its colouring and its contour.
          Moreover, their beauty also absolves them from the necessity of
          being remarkable in any other direction. After all, if one is
          beautiful, it is not also obligatory to be useful. One does not
          demand of Leonardo da Vinci's <span class="tei tei-q">“Mona
          Lisa”</span> to be a screen as well as a picture, nor appreciate an
          exquisite piece of Sevres china any the less because it is also
          neither a candlestick nor an ash-tray! We demand from them nothing
          beyond their beauty, and, finding it, we are satisfied. Also we
          count our life worth while according to the loveliness which it
          contains. Every man starts out in the hope that he will marry a
          pretty <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page16">[pg 16]</span> woman.
          That most men's taste is not exacting, and love proverbially blind,
          is a blessing for which few lovers are sufficiently grateful. In
          the prayers of gratitude offered up by Humanity to God, such an one
          should be included: <span class="tei tei-q">“Praise be unto Him who
          makes most of us beautiful at some time to some one!”</span> Beauty
          is, after all, its own forgiveness of sins in the heart of those
          who love it. Only when a woman's looks are fading does her husband
          begin to realize that neither can she cook. Until then, he is only
          too glad to suffer indigestion at her hands. That a beautiful woman
          should die young is, after all, only to wish her the best of all
          possible blessings in this best of all possible worlds.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All the same,
          what a pleasant destiny! And yet, perhaps, those who are permitted
          to gaze upon beauty without being themselves beautiful are the most
          fortunate of all. And that is the position of most of us, thank
          God. As it is more thrilling to watch a pageant than to take part
          in one, so, to be able to gaze undisturbed upon the Pageant of
          Beauty as it passes before our generation to take its place in the
          wonderful procession marching down the ages, is a far more peaceful
          proceeding than to form part of that procession. After all, the
          most envied in a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span lang="fr" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr">tableau vivant</span></em> are not
          those who figure in it, but those who have been able to secure the
          best position from which to view it. The man who secures a
          <span class="tei tei-q">“masterpiece”</span> is far more gratified
          than the artist who created it. So, while we bow down in adoration
          before Beauty, let us also be thankful that the greatest privilege
          of all lies in an opportunity to regard it. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Beauty and sadness,”</span> George Macdonald has
          written, <span class="tei tei-q">“always go together.”</span> But
          to be able to gaze on Beauty—that, surely, is the most undiluted
          joy in life.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Almost every
          woman believes that, though Nature may not have made her beautiful,
          of her own accord she can achieve charm. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Charm”</span> is the Possibility which Desire dangles
          before the nose of Hope. And every woman, who <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> a
          woman endeavours to make that Possibility a Certainty once, at
          least, in her life. To be beautiful is a great deal, but to be
          charming is of greater value and infinitely less dangerous to one's
          peace of mind. Especially to know that one is irresistible to some
          one whom one has no particular desire to resist—that surely is
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">everything</span></em>! What, then, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em>
          Charm?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Artemus Ward
          described a charming woman as <span class="tei tei-q">“born to make
          hash of men's buzzoms”</span>—which, though comprehensive, does not
          lead us very far, and sounds perilously near being a cooking
          recipe. Oscar Wilde said: <span class="tei tei-q">“All charming
          people, I fancy, are spoiled. It is the secret of their
          attraction”</span>—which, personally, I disbelieve absolutely.
          Spoiled people manage to get their own way, it is true, since the
          majority of us are so faint-hearted that we find it easier to offer
          ourselves in sacrifice than play our part in a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "fr">scène à faire</span></em>. But the effect of a metaphorical
          foot on one's neck is by no means a satisfying sensation, though we
          may endure it heroically. Longfellow described a charming woman as
          <span class="tei tei-q">“when she passed it seemed like the ceasing
          of exquisite music,”</span> and this, though pleasing to the ear,
          seems to say so much and mean as little as any modern drawing-room
          ballad. Shakespeare, perhaps, came nearer giving us a word-picture
          of Charm when he wrote: <span class="tei tei-q">“She told him
          stories to delight his ear; she showed him favours to allure his
          eye”</span>; but even that description does not convey to us much
          more than the effort of a cook to fascinate a policeman. Charm is
          something more subtle than the ability to tell a smoking-room story
          in a drawing-room way and exhibit the best <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“points”</span> Nature has given us with a fine
          semblance of doing so unconsciously. Perhaps the Dictionary gives
          the best definition when it explains Charm as being <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“something possessing occult power or
          influence.”</span> Occultism seems the easiest explanation of the
          personal <span class="tei tei-q">“sway”</span> which some outwardly
          unattractive person wields over <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page18">[pg 18]</span> the most unlikely people, people who, by
          all reason and logic, policy and prudence, ought not to be thus
          fascinated. Love is easier to explain than Charm; or rather,
          perhaps, I ought to add, than that emotion which so often passes
          muster for Love, that emotion which, though it often ends in
          marriage, or divorce, or a six-months' despair, may arise from no
          more solid foundation than solitude, a moonlight night, and the
          sex-appeal of two people in a <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“romantic”</span> mood. But just as Time is the supreme
          test of Love, so it is also the supreme test of Charm. A woman who
          is as charming at forty-nine as she was, say, at thirty, must
          necessarily possess something inherent in her nature, not
          recognizable as <span class="tei tei-q">“beauty”</span> perchance,
          which leads men nevertheless—and, what is infinitely more
          difficult, other <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">women—</span></em> by a single hair. Charm,
          indeed, has nothing whatever to do with either beauty or youth. Its
          genius lies in being able to delude the world that it is both
          beautiful as well as youthful, no matter what adverse criticism
          artists may indulge in, nor how many cold, ugly facts Father Time
          may bring forward to dispel the illusion. Real Charm rises superior
          to both. It is a quality which, because it cannot be analysed,
          cannot therefore be destroyed. So it is easier to call it
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Occult,”</span> which the Dictionary
          informs us is a power <span class="tei tei-q">“hidden from the eye
          and understanding.”</span> On the other hand, perhaps, it may be an
          unconscious form of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mesmerism</span></em>, the mesmerist being as
          totally unaware of his gift as the mesmerised is of his power.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if we cannot
          break up Charm into its component parts, we can, at least, say
          definitely what it is not. It cannot be cultivated, for one thing,
          though life and experience may help to make it finer, more
          exquisite. Nor is it necessarily the natural possession of either
          beautiful or clever people. Most of us have met men and women who
          were both mediocre in appearance and uncultivated in mind, who
          nevetheless were charming in no slight degree, in that the evidence
          of charm be admiration and friendship. The natural gift they
          possessed was the power to make all those with whom they came in
          contact <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">feel charming</span></em> too, and this, after
          all, may or may not be the great secret of Charm? Beauty is
          delightful to gaze upon; but it is, as it were, a self-contained
          quality—we cannot share in it except as spectators. But the genius
          of a charming man or woman is that they help to bring out all that
          is best in other people. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page19">[pg
          19]</span> Beauty only makes other people feel more beautiful or
          infinitely plainer and either is a very lonely feeling. But in
          Charm we seem to share; it seems to mingle us, not only with the
          charmer, but with all the world around them. Beauty is like a
          wonderful jewel; but Charm, if I may refer to it in metaphor,
          resembles an ideal home. And who would not rather pawn their
          jewellery than break up a happy domesticity? It is perhaps this
          feeling which Charm gives us of being perfectly <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“at home”</span> that is its most precious possession.
          So, may be, it is really the one word we give to that quality of
          the mind and heart which mingles both sympathy and understanding in
          equal quantities. Most women, when they desire to cultivate Charm,
          read up the Memoirs of Ninon de l'Enclos, whereas they would be
          much wiser to analyze the attractive qualities of the dog! Animals
          are always charming, because they are always natural; and to be
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">natural</span></em> is ninety per cent of
          fascination. The reason so many men and women are bores is because
          so many men and women are never content to make the best of what
          they are, but are always pretending to be what they are not,
          generally ending their performance by giving a dismal caricature of
          the Ideal they have tried so vainly to emulate. Even honesty in
          this world of masks is charming. I don't, of course, mean that
          honesty which will scrupulously repay threepenny bits, but the
          honesty which will be content to be exactly what it is, without
          pretence or disguise, and with no additional trimming in the way of
          either gold lace or sackcloth and ashes. An artificial person is
          never charming, though they may sometimes achieve a charming
          effect. An honest wrongdoer is infinitely more attractive than a
          Saint who pretends that he has done no wrong. The great charm of a
          charming person is that he can mingle the most diverse human
          elements, bringing them down to the one common denominator of
          Humanity, where all that is true in Nature forges that link which
          binds men together in brotherhood and humility. Charm pierces all
          disguise: its influence is so delightful, since it helps us to be
          our true selves, reprieving us for the nonce from that effort of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“pretending”</span> which the world expects
          to find, and is embarrassed when this expectation fails. Charm,
          then, is not a gift like Beauty, but a grateful acceptance,
          unconsciously illustrating in our hearts the fact that it is more
          satisfying to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">give</span></em> than to receive. In this way
          the Loquacious finds a good Listener most attractive, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page20">[pg 20]</span> and the Strong are never so
          happy with themselves as when administering to the needs of the
          Weak. Two <span class="tei tei-q">“born talkers”</span> were born
          to hate each other; just as one good listener finds another good
          listener exceedingly dull company. That, too, is why Reserve thinks
          Vivacity a thing of infinite repose, and the Vivacious discover in
          the Reserved a silent strength more inspiring than eloquence. It is
          the man or woman whose gifts bring out all the best in us who we
          call <span class="tei tei-q">“charming,”</span> since further
          description seems unnecessary. Charming people, then, must perforce
          be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">natural</span></em>, since artificiality
          raises between men a bulwark which not even Good Intentions can
          scale. They must also be sympathetic, since those who demand
          sympathy are rarely more than tolerated. They must also possess
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Understanding,”</span> since without
          Understanding one might as well reveal oneself to a brick wall.
          Granted these things, it will not take us very long to find them
          beautiful as well.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Charm is not,
          then, an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">assertive</span></em> quality, unless
          unselfishness can resemble <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“assertiveness.”</span> Rather is it the power to draw
          from others those natural qualities which otherwise lie dormant
          within them. We all yearn to be our true selves: the difficulty is
          that we receive so little encouragement from those with whom we are
          brought into contact. Thus, as I wrote before, we are all apt to
          find charm in those who, as it were, seem to possess the key to our
          hearts. We delight to talk to them, because with them we feel safe
          from that danger which besets us so often—the danger of being
          wilfully misunderstood, wilfully misjudged, our <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“dreams”</span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“ideals”</span> wilfully distorted. In their society we
          expand, living and speaking as free men would live and speak in a
          world of real freedom. Leaving them to return to the world is as a
          <span class="tei tei-q">“farewell”</span> to liberty upon
          re-entering prison. Physically they may not attract us; though,
          such is the potency of Charm, that those we like we very soon begin
          to admire. Which is a blessing without the least disguise, since it
          enables those who have neither youth nor beauty nor wealth to
          recommend them to find friendship and love nevertheless. Charm is,
          as it were, the passion of a <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“soul”</span>—a passion in which there is nothing
          physical, but rather a mental and spiritual elation overwhelming
          the simple <span class="tei tei-q">“call of the flesh.”</span> Thus
          real Charm is ageless, because it can triumph even over physical
          decay. The Charm of Innocence; the Charm of Youth;—these states do
          not really <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page21">[pg 21]</span>
          belong to those gifts of sympathy and understanding which are the
          two chief elements of Charm. Youth and Innocence leave us at last.
          Our regret over their departure is at best a purely academic
          sorrow. In the hearts of those who find us charming we know that we
          can defy Age. Our greater Knowledge will but give us a clearer
          Understanding, and for these things shall we be loved. Charm, in
          fact, is what maturity offers men and women in exchange for their
          Youth. In finding it, they escape that loneliness which is the one
          haunting terror of growing old. We speak, of course, of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“charming girls”</span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“charming young men,”</span> but what we really mean is
          that they are merely nice and young. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Charming,”</span> indeed, is a word which we use as
          thoughtlessly as we use <span class="tei tei-q">“Love.”</span> We
          employ it to express prettiness and elegance, daintiness and
          good-nature. But none of these things necessarily express
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Charm”</span> any more than do those
          couples, who make use of the trees in Hyde Park to cuddle beneath
          them, express Love. They are just words we employ because our
          Dictionary is limited and we cannot think of any other. Real Charm
          is something much more subtle than any of these things—more subtle,
          yet more potent. In fact, no one may pride themselves on the
          possession of Charm until Time has robbed them of all those
          <span class="tei tei-q">“minor beauties.”</span> Indeed, if I were
          asked to explain Charm—and in thus being asked I should be faced by
          the difficulty of explaining the well-nigh inexplicable—I should
          sum it up as a kind of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">super-intelligence of the</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“soul,”</span></em> an intelligence which combines the
          wisdom of the Heart with the wisdom of the World, the Wisdom of the
          Serpent with some of the guileless optimism of the Dove; above all,
          the gift of interpreting men and women to themselves, thus bringing
          to their troubled <span class="tei tei-q">“souls”</span> that sense
          of repose which comes from an opportunity to be completely natural,
          and, in being natural, to arise refreshed in body and spirit, ready
          for further efforts to solve the problem of true Happiness in
          Life.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page22">[pg 22]</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the preceding
          pages I have tried to explain my belief that Beauty is some quality
          from which we seek inspiration, and that Charm is that natural gift
          which helps us to give inspiration to others. When Beauty is
          combined with Charm—a rarer combination than Society papers would
          lead us to believe—you have that quality, akin to genius, which has
          made a few beautiful women stand out, bold figures, in the long
          history of the world.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In olden days,
          when monarchs were wont to wield their sceptres rather in the
          manner of a bomb-thrower his bombs, it was sufficient for a woman
          to attract the Royal eye for her at once to gain the reputation of
          world-wide beauty. Royal mistresses were always lovely <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la">ipso facto</span></em>. It was <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "fr">lése majesté</span></em> to dispute the Royal taste in
          feminine beauty. All the same, as one gazes nowadays upon these
          sirens of a past age, one confesses to oneself that most monarchs
          set out on their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span lang="fr" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr">voyages à Cythère</span></em> in
          very rudely constructed barques. Instinctively, however, we still
          try to see these ladies through Royal eyes, praising them
          accordingly. Maybe our professed admiration for them is all part
          and parcel of that glamour which we weave, even to-day, around our
          <span class="tei tei-q">“lesser”</span> terrestrial deities. A lady
          mayoress still shares with duchesses the genius of always smiling
          <span class="tei tei-q">“graciously.”</span> (Until such a time, of
          course, as, her husband being denied re-election, we designate
          those signs of amiability on her part merely as varieties of the
          much-reviled <span class="tei tei-q">“grin.”</span>)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this the
          Twentieth Century the aesthetic taste of monarchs is no longer
          approved unquestioningly by all the world. The power of a King's
          mistress is at present more social than aesthetic. To-day the
          photographer is more potent in the creation of a woman's reputation
          for beauty than the most autocratic emperor. Photography is no
          longer merely the business of exact reproduction—it is an Art,
          penetrating in its psychological illustration of character. As one
          gazes at those depressing likenesses of <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page24">[pg 24]</span> lovely women who lived sixty years ago,
          one realizes at once the popularity of such painters as
          Winterhalter. He, at any rate, made his <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“sitters”</span> look like half-sisters to the Empress
          Eugenie, in a pose designed expressly for the decoration of a
          chocolate box. To-day the photographer has usurped the position of
          all but the greatest portrait-painters. And this, for the reason
          that the best modern photographers must also of necessity be
          artists. They must undergo something of the same rigorous training
          as painters. It is no longer a question of a good camera, a studio,
          and the exhibition case of <span class="tei tei-q">“samples”</span>
          hung outside the front door. A modern photographer must understand
          all the nuances of light and shade, tone value, colour, pose,
          proportion. His studies must have the characteristics of
          first-class paintings—minus, of course, their colour. Nevertheless,
          this omission must be suggested through the variations of light and
          shade. It is because Mr. Hoppé is also a painter that the
          reproductions in this book are so superb in all those details which
          go to make up perfection in portraiture. They are not merely
          photographs (as we in our ignorance often designate photography as
          <span class="tei tei-q">“mere”</span>). They represent an art
          nearly akin to the finest portrait painting. Note, for example, the
          exquisite manner in which light and shade has been employed to
          throw into relief just those most lovely features which each face
          possesses individually, even the most beautiful. Note especially in
          this regard how cleverly the artist has caught the different
          characteristics which belong to each individual nationality—the Red
          Indian type of beauty, for example, as contrasted with that of the
          English. The difference is not so marked in the contour of the
          face, nor in the features, but in the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eyes</span></em>.
          There you have a whole volume of comparisons. Those of the Red
          Indian Beauty, exquisite in their shape, seem nevertheless to have,
          as it were, a shutter closed down behind them. They are
          unfathomable. The typical English eyes, on the other hand, how
          clear they are, how open; how we seem able to see right into
          them—deep down into the labyrinth of thought! Examine the Spanish
          portrait, and note how cleverly the artist has thrown into relief
          those most lovely characteristics of Spanish beauty—the formation
          of the chin, the eyebrows, the fascinating manner in which the hair
          is arranged as a framework for the modelling of the whole face. The
          Gipsy beauty—how admirably it shows the wayward grace of the Gipsy
          race; its wide <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page25">[pg 25]</span>
          and open countenance, suggestive of life led in the free air; the
          characteristic eyes, with their hint of Asiatic origin. Take also
          the picture of a typical Italian beauty—in this case Neapolitan in
          type. Even in this photograph one can almost see that blue-black
          tint so beautiful in the hair of Italian women. Note, too, the
          perfect Roman profile, the lovely upper lip, the sensitive
          nostrils—all so suggestive of a nation in which emotion and feeling
          are rarely suppressed. The Russian beauty—how attractive and how
          typical she is! Note the almost square jaw, the sensuous mouth, the
          upper eyelid slightly overhanging—a characteristic which lends to
          Russian women that unique fascination which belongs to the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“language of the eye.”</span> Indeed, it
          may be said that a Russian woman can express herself by her eyes
          alone, whereas an English woman <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">talks</span></em>,
          and yet is often misunderstood.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In discussing
          these portraits with Mr. Hoppé he revealed to me a somewhat
          unconventional belief—his belief that, in America, there is no such
          thing as a <span class="tei tei-q">“typical American face.”</span>
          Every type is represented over there, and no one predominates over
          another. American women differ from English women in a certain
          native <span class="tei tei-q">“chic,”</span> approaching almost to
          the instinctive grace of the French woman; a certain intellectual
          <span class="tei tei-q">“flair”</span>; a <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“liveliness”</span>—if I may so express it—all typical
          of a mixed race, still young enough to be content to imitate
          unconsciously the type it most admires, and being able to do so
          since it possesses the inherited characteristics of so many
          different nationalities.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This book gives
          us a wonderful example of representative French beauty. Note the
          mouth—how typical it is! The perfect poise of the head on the neck;
          the equally beautiful throat and shoulders. Moreover, this portrait
          is especially interesting, since it shows us how lovely white hair
          can be as the framework of a still youthful face.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To contrast the
          Chinese and Japanese beauties is also interesting. There is a
          gentle sweetness about the Japanese face which is undoubtedly
          appealing; but it does not compare in character with that of the
          Chinese lady. The contour of the Chinese face, though less round,
          has a straighter nose, the modelling of every feature is firmer,
          infinitely less flaccid. It is interesting, too, to compare the
          Cuban beauty with that of the Hawaiian. The latter type is less
          classical; there is a stronger influence of the negro in it.
          Indeed, the Hawaiian type of beauty may be described as being only
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page26">[pg 26]</span> just far enough
          removed from the negro to be pretty. In the Cuban woman the nose is
          more classically modelled; the whole contour of the face nearly
          resembles that of the European. Even in Western eyes she possesses
          charm.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One hardly knows
          how to admire the Portuguese type of beauty. It is undoubtedly
          striking—though, if I may so express it, the model chosen by Mr.
          Hoppé seems too unapproachable to make any facile appeal. It is,
          however, interesting in this portrait to observe traces of the
          Spanish type, combined with an undoubtedly Moorish influence as
          seen in the way the eyes are set in the face. The eyes, indeed, are
          the most fascinating part of the picture. Regard them well, they
          are uncanny; they are almost unreal. I have seen eyes like that in
          crudely carved wooden idols—so primitive in their modelling, yet so
          extraordinarily expressive in their regard: <em class=

          eyes with, as it were, an impenetrable blind drawn close down
          behind them, shutting out thought. If not the most strictly
          beautiful, this Portuguese type is one of the most psychologically
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">interesting</span></em> in the whole pageant
          of this book of beauty.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And yet, how
          attractive in their variety all these faces are! Could anything be
          more alluring than the lovely eyes, the perfectly shaped mouth of
          the Chilian beauty, a beauty also strongly characteristic of the
          Spanish type? How lovely, too, is the Greek face, with the nose, as
          it were, a deliberate continuation of the forehead. There is
          passion and grace in the Indian woman, with her lovely supple body,
          the expression of melancholy in her face, those exquisite velvet
          eyes the size of which seem almost completely to dwarf the other
          features!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among such a
          galaxy of lovely women each man may surely find one who represents
          to him his physical ideal. The charm of these portraits is that
          each beautiful woman, typical of her race, possesses some unique
          beauty which belongs to her nationality alone. In each face there
          is a charm which more than compensates us for its deviation from
          the characteristics we, as Englishmen, most especially admire. He
          must be prejudiced indeed in favour of one type who can deny a
          certain loveliness to any one of them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Very few there
          will surely be malcontent to leave this book to posterity as a
          portrait-gallery of some of the loveliest women representative of
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page27">[pg 27]</span> the world of
          our day. Naturally, there are other beautiful women in the world
          who are not included. This is one book—not a whole library! But who
          will dispute the right of those who do appear therein? No
          one—surely!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And, after all,
          were a Martian suddenly to descend to Earth and demand of us
          representatives of the finest examples of the Human Race, should we
          not parade before him our most beautiful women?</p>

              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=

              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>
